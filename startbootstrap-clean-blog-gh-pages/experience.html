                        <p>I have had the opportunity to work many jobs in my life - I would like to focus in on 3 specific jobs I was able to gain experience from in this portion of the resume!</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Psychiatric Technician</h2>
                        <p>When I returned home from my mission I worked at the Utah State Hospital as a Psychiatric Technician for just over a year! For this job I was assigned to the forensic portion of the State Hospital. As "Psych Techs" we were to be on the floor of the units caring for patients and making sure everything was under control. The main skill I took away from this job is probably patience in the work space. Working with many variations of mental illness required a specific amount of patience and care! It was a great experience and I was able to learn a lot!</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">BYU Tech Support</h2>
                        <p>After working at the state hospital I needed to find a job that I could work for part time as a student! BYU Tech support was the perfect job as I was able to increase my computer efficiency while also haing time to work on homework and be around the campus. The main skill I took away from this job is problem-solving abilities. We always had to troubleshoot problems as a support face for BYU.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Vivint Moves Specialist</h2>
                        <p>I also previously worked for Vivint Home Security as a moves specialist for a period of time! In this job my task was to set up appointments for those who were moving locations and needed the vivint security system to be moved with them. We were in charge of scheduling appointments, upselling, and troubleshooting. In this job the main skill I learned was people skills, we had to work through many different situaitons and sometimes de-escalate or up sell.</p>
